# ml-cft repository is the collection of codes we have used in our CS460: Machine Learning course project during Fall 2020.
#Project title: Application of neural networks to conformal field theory
#Project description: Classifying scale vs conformal invariance in flat space-time and embedding space, recognising crossing symmetric 4-point functions, classifying the Z2 symmetry of Ising model & predicting the OPE coefficients using neural networks.
#Implemented in Python with Keras & TensorFlow API.
#Acknowledgments: The authors would like to acknowledge S. Lal & M.Z. Zaz whose notebooks have been particularly helpful during the project.

#data-gen branch contains the codes to generate data.
#model branch contains the machine learning implementation.

#Project version 1 to be presented on 16 December 2020.
#Upto this date, the project abstract goes as:
#Abstract: A recent study by Lal et. al.(2020) applied machine learning tools to conformal field theory for the first time. In this project, we have reproduced some of the important results on the proof-of-concept of usage of ML to CFT. We have extended the formalism to spinning conformal correlators and state the results. To better understand the previously obtained results for spinless operators, we have iterated the analysis in embedding space.
