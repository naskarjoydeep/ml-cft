# ml-cft repository is the collection of codes we have used in our CS460: Machine Learning course project during Fall 2020.
#Project title: Application of neural networks to conformal field theory
#Project description: Classifying scale vs conformal invariance in flat space-time and embedding space, recognising crossing symmetric 4-point functions, classifying the Z2 symmetry of Ising model & predictingthe OPE coefficients using neural networks.
#Implemented in Python with Keras & TensorFlow API.
#Acknowledgments: The authors would like to acknowledge M.Z. Zaz whose notebooks have been particularly helpful during the project.
